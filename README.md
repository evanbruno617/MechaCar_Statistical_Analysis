## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Using this regression and summary functions the variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values was vehicle length and ground clearance. This is due to the fact that their p value is small giving us a confidence level of 99%. Therefore the slope of linear model is not considered to be zero as our data is correlated with mpg as we are given slopes. I believe this linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes efectively with our r squared value being over 0.7 we can say that there is a strong correlation between the data and the ability to predict mpg.
